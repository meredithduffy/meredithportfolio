      "description": "Welcome! I'm glad you're here. \n\nI'm a senior at The George Washington University studying Communication with a double-minor in Journalism and American Studies. \n\nA few things I love: reading, current events, music, graphic design, and writing. I hope to incorporate my passions into my work by using innovative strategies.\n\nI have marketing experience at a start-up, at a nonprofit, and at a consulting firm. I also worked on two of the most crucial Senate campaigns of the 2020 cycle, for Jon Ossoff and Sara Gideon. On campus, I've hosted a radio show, led a networking trip to New York, wrote for the newspaper, and produced videos for student organizations. \n\nWhen I'm not busy being a #youngprofessional, I'm probably biking, listening to Dominic Fike, bullet journaling, or trying to get you to talk about Maine politics.
