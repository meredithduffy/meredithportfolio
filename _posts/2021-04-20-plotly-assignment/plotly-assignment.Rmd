```{r}
fig <- plot_ly(flights)
  x = c('dest')
  y = c('air_time' > 400)
  type = "bar"
  color = "red"
fig <- fig %>% layout(title = "Flight Times",
         xaxis = list(title = "Airports"),
         yaxis = list (title = "Airpors with Long Flight Time In Minutes"))
fig
```

Above I attempted to plot which destination airports have the most flights over 400 minutes long.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
